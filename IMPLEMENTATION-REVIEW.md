# Private Class Tracker - Multi-School Platform Review

## ✅ Completed Features

### 1. Multi-School Architecture
- **Core Change**: The platform has been successfully re-architected from a single-instance application to a multi-tenant solution capable of supporting multiple, distinct schools. ✅
- **School Provisioning**: A Super-Admin ("Evan") role exists to create new, independent school instances via a dedicated UI. ✅
- **New Login Flow**: The application entry point is now a school selection page. Users first select their school, then proceed to a role-based login. ✅

### 2. Multi-Tenant Role-Based Access Control

#### Super Administrator (Evan/Developer) ✅
- **Role**: The single, global administrator with developer-level privileges.
- **Can Create**: New school instances on the platform.
- **Access**: Can provision the initial School Moderator for each new school.

#### School Moderator Privileges ✅
- **Role**: The designated administrator for a *single school*.
- **Scope**: All actions are strictly limited to their assigned school's jurisdiction.
- **User Management**: Can create/edit Teacher and Student accounts for their school.
- **Financial Control**: Full control over financial features, but only in reference to their school's teachers and students.
- **Data Management**: Full access to their school's Sessions, Classrooms, and Student Profiles.

#### Teacher Privileges ✅
- **Scope**: Strictly limited to their assigned school.
- **View**: Can view student accounts within their school.
- **Profile Management**: Can edit own contact information.
- **Session Management**: Can confirm sessions and add notes for their students.

#### Student Accounts ✅
- **Type**: Data-only accounts (no login) belonging to a specific school.
- **Management**: Created and managed by their school's Moderator or the Super-Admin.
- **Purpose**: Serve as interactive records for moderators to track classes and collaborate.

### 3. Backend Data Isolation Audit (Security Enhancement) ✅
- **Complete Service Audit**: A full audit of all core backend services (`StudentsService`, `ClassroomsService`, `SessionsService`) has been completed.
- **Strict Data Scoping**: Every database operation (read, write, update, delete) is now strictly scoped by `schoolId`, ensuring true data isolation between schools.
- **Secure Controllers**: All corresponding API controllers have been secured with authentication guards and updated to pass the `schoolId` from the user's session to the service layer.

### 4. Study Location Feature
- **Functionality**: The `studyLocation` feature for managing different campuses or branches is implemented and functions *within* each school. ✅
- **Management**: A school's Moderator can assign and edit study locations for their users and students. ✅

## 📋 Pending Tasks & Priorities

### High Priority
1.  **Remove Forced Password Change**: As per your direction, the entire feature forcing users to change their password on first login needs to be removed from the backend and frontend. The ability for users to voluntarily change their password should remain.

### Backend Updates
1.  **Finalize Teacher Username Login**: The backend is prepared for username validation; a final check and activation are needed.

### Frontend Development
1.  **Build School Moderator UI**: Create the necessary dashboard/UI for School Moderators to manage their school's users, students, and settings.
2.  **Implement School-Specific Branding**: Develop the feature to allow schools to customize their name, logo, and theme.
3.  **Finalize Teacher Profile Page**: Ensure the `/teacher-profile` page is fully functional for voluntary password and profile updates.

    *   Create two separate schools with unique users.
    *   Verify that a Moderator from School A cannot view or interact with any data from School B.
