### PowerShell Command Issues & Solutions

#### Common Errors Encountered:
1. **PowerShell `&&` Syntax Error:**
   ```
   The token '&&' is not a valid statement separator in this version.
   ```
   - **Issue**: PowerShell doesn't support `&&` like Bash/Linux terminals
   - **Solution**: Use `;` instead of `&&` for command chaining
   - **Examples**:
     - ‚ùå `cd frontend && npm run dev`
     - ‚úÖ `cd frontend; npm run dev`

2. **Port Already in Use Error:**
   ```
   Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001
   ```
   - **Issue**: Frontend server already running on port 3001
   - **Solution**: Kill existing process or use different port
   - **Check**: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001`

3. **Missing Script Error:**
   ```
   npm error Missing script: "start:dev"
   ```
   - **Issue**: Wrong script name or running from wrong directory
   - **Backend Solution**: Use `npm run dev` from backend directory
   - **Check Scripts**: `npm run` to see available scripts

#### Correct PowerShell Commands:
- **Start Frontend**: `cd frontend; npm run dev`
- **Start Backend**: `cd backend; npm run dev`
- **Install Dependencies**: `npm install --workspaces`
- **Database Migration**: `cd backend; npx prisma db push`
- **Check Ports**: `netstat -ano | findstr ":3001 :8000"`
- **Kill Process**: `taskkill /PID [process_id] /F`

#### Current Server Status:
