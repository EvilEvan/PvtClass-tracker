# Special Request Notes Feature

## Overview
The Special Request Notes feature allows moderators to send and receive important notifications that require acknowledgment. This system ensures critical information is communicated effectively across the moderator team.

## Features

### 1. Create Special Request Notes
- **Who can create**: Admins and Moderators
- **Priority levels**: HIGH, NORMAL, LOW
- **Character limits**: 
  - Title: 100 characters
  - Message: 1000 characters
- **Email notifications**: Automatically sent to all moderators
- **Real-time updates**: Dashboard refreshes automatically

### 2. Email Notifications
- **Automatic sending**: When a special request is created
- **Recipients**: All users with MODERATOR role
- **Content includes**:
  - Request title and priority
  - Full message content
  - Creator information
  - Timestamp
  - Link to moderator dashboard

### 3. Login Popup System
- **Auto-display**: Shows unacknowledged notes when moderators log in
- **Cannot be dismissed**: Until all notes are acknowledged
- **Visual indicators**: Priority-based color coding and icons
- **Batch acknowledgment**: Multiple notes can be acknowledged at once

### 4. Acknowledgment Tracking
- **Individual tracking**: Each moderator must acknowledge each note
- **Timestamp recording**: When each acknowledgment was made
- **Duplicate prevention**: Cannot acknowledge the same note twice
- **Statistics**: Dashboard shows acknowledgment counts

## Database Schema

  is_active BOOLEAN DEFAULT true,
  created_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  updated_at DATETIME DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  FOREIGN KEY (created_by_id) REFERENCES users(id)
);
```

### SpecialRequestAcknowledgment Table

  FOREIGN KEY (note_id) REFERENCES special_request_notes(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,

## Security Considerations

### Access Control
- Only MODERATOR and ADMIN roles can create/view special requests

- Only creators and ADMINs can deactivate notes

### Data Validation

- SQL injection prevention via Prisma ORM
- XSS protection through React's built-in escaping

### Email Security
- Email addresses validated before sending
- Rate limiting to prevent spam
- Secure email templates
