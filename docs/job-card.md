# Job Card: Cloud Deployment Preparation & Troubleshooting

**Objective**: Refactor the application to remove development-specific configurations, prepare it for a professional cloud deployment, and provide a comprehensive step-by-step guide for the process.

---

### Phase 1: Codebase Refactoring for Deployment

The initial codebase was configured to run only on a local machine (`localhost`), which is unsuitable for a multi-user, production environment. This phase addressed those limitations.

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Frontend URL Externalization:**
    *   **Removed Hardcoded URLs**: All instances of `http://localhost:8000` and `http://localhost:3001` across all frontend pages and hooks were removed.
    *   **Implemented Environment Variables**: Created a `.env.local` file to manage local development URLs (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`). This allows the frontend to point to the local backend during testing and a live backend in production without code changes.
    *   **Updated All `fetch` Calls**: Modified every API request in the frontend to use the new environment variables.

2.  **Backend CORS & Port Configuration:**
    *   **Flexible CORS Policy**: Updated `main.ts` and `app.gateway.ts` to use a `CORS_ORIGIN` environment variable. This secures the backend by ensuring it only accepts requests from approved frontend URLs (e.g., the Vercel deployment URL).
    *   **Dynamic Port Binding**: Configured the backend to listen on `process.env.PORT`, which is the standard required by cloud hosting providers like Render.

3.  **Database Provider Update:**
    *   **Production-Ready Database**: Modified `prisma/schema.prisma` to change the database provider from `sqlite` (for development) to `postgresql` (for production).
    *   **Secure Connection String**: Configured Prisma to use a `DATABASE_URL` environment variable, allowing the application to connect to a managed cloud database securely.

### Phase 2: Deployment Guidance

A detailed, step-by-step guide was provided to take the application from the local machine to a live, publicly accessible state.

**Recommended Stack:**
- **Frontend**: Vercel
- **Backend**: Render
- **Database**: Render (PostgreSQL)

**Guide Summary:**
1.  **Code Setup**: How to create and use the `.env.local` file.
2.  **Version Control**: How to push the project to a private GitHub repository.
3.  **Backend & Database Deployment (Render)**:
    *   Creating a PostgreSQL instance on Render.
    *   Creating a Web Service for the NestJS backend.
    *   Setting environment variables (`DATABASE_URL`, `JWT_SECRET`).
    *   Running database migrations (`npx prisma migrate deploy`) in the cloud environment.
4.  **Frontend Deployment (Vercel)**:
    *   Connecting the GitHub repository to Vercel.
    *   Setting environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_WS_URL`) to point to the live Render backend.
5.  **Final Connection**: Updating the `CORS_ORIGIN` variable on Render to point to the live Vercel frontend URL, completing the secure connection.

### Phase 3: Local Development Troubleshooting

The changes required for deployment introduced temporary issues for local testing. These were identified and resolved.

**Tasks Completed:**

1.  **Resolved Database Connection Error**:
    *   **Problem**: The backend failed to start locally because it was configured to look for a PostgreSQL database that didn't exist on the local machine.
    *   **Solution**: Temporarily reverted `prisma/schema.prisma` to use `sqlite` for local development, allowing the developer to continue testing seamlessly.

2.  **Fixed Backend Syntax Error**:
    *   **Problem**: A typo (`Unterminated template literal`) in `backend/src/classrooms/classrooms.service.ts` was preventing the backend from compiling and running.
    *   **Solution**: Located and corrected the syntax error, enabling the backend to start successfully.

---

### Outcome

The Private Class Tracker application is now architecturally sound and fully prepared for a robust, scalable cloud deployment. The codebase is flexible, secure, and follows modern deployment best practices. The user is equipped with a clear, actionable guide to get the system live on the internet and has a stable, working local development environment.

# Job Card: New Authentication Flow & UI

**Objective**: Overhaul the application's entry point to create a clear, role-based login system. The new flow will present distinct options for "Moderator" and "Teacher" logins, with a separate, discreet access point for the "Evan" developer/admin platform. It also includes a forced password change mechanism for first-time users.

---

### Phase 1: Backend API Enhancements for Password Management

**Objective**: Strengthen the backend to support individual password changes and track first-time logins.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Update Database Schema**:
    *   **Action**: Modify `backend/prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   **Change**: Add a new boolean field `passwordChanged` to the `User` model with a default value of `false`.
    *   **Purpose**: This flag will track whether a new user has changed their temporary initial password.
    *   **Command**: Run `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-password-changed-flag` after updating the schema.

2.  **Implement Password Change Endpoint**:
    *   **Action**: Create a new `PUT` endpoint in `backend/src/auth/auth.controller.ts` at the path `users/:id/password`.
    *   **Purpose**: This endpoint will handle requests to change a user's password. It is currently missing and is called by the `teacher-profile.tsx` page.

3.  **Create `changePassword` Service Logic**:
    *   **Action**: Implement the corresponding `changePassword` method in `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`.
    *   **Logic**:
        *   Accept `userId`, `currentPassword`, and `newPassword` as arguments.
        *   Find the user by their `userId`.
        *   Securely compare the provided `currentPassword` with the hashed password in the database using `bcrypt.compare`.
        *   If valid, hash the `newPassword` with `bcrypt.hash`.
        *   Update the user's record with the new hashed password and set `passwordChanged` to `true`.

4.  **Enhance Login Response**:
    *   **Action**: Modify the `login` method in `backend/src/auth/auth.service.ts`.
    *   **Change**: Ensure the user object returned upon successful login includes the `passwordChanged` field.
    *   **Purpose**: To inform the frontend whether it needs to initiate the forced password change flow.

---

### Phase 2: Frontend UI - New Login Experience

**Objective**: Replace the current direct-to-login page with a more intuitive, role-selection screen that aligns with the user's specifications.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Create Role Selection Page**:
    *   **Action**: Create a new file `frontend/src/pages/login-select.tsx`.
    *   **Content**: This page will be the new startup window for unauthenticated users. It will display prominent, clickable options for **"Moderator"** and **"Teacher"**.
    *   **Developer Access**: A discreet link with the text **"Evan"** will be placed at the bottom of the screen, styled at half the font size, to serve as the entry point for the developer/admin platform.

2.  **Create Unified Login Page**:
    *   **Action**: Create a new file `frontend/src/pages/login.tsx`.
    *   **Functionality**: This page will render a standard login form (username/password). It will receive a `role` from the role-selection page via a URL query parameter (e.g., `/login?role=Teacher`).
    *   **Dynamic Title**: The login page's title will dynamically change to "Moderator Login", "Teacher Login", or "Developer Platform Access" based on the `role` parameter.

3.  **Update Application Entry Point**:
    *   **Action**: Modify `frontend/src/pages/index.tsx`.
    *   **Change**: All unauthenticated users will be redirected to the new `/login-select` page, replacing the old logic that checked for admin existence.

4.  **Connect UI Flow**:
    *   The "Moderator" and "Teacher" options on `/login-select` will link to `/login?role=Moderator` and `/login?role=Teacher` respectively.
    *   The **"Evan"** link will link to `/login?role=Admin`, directing to the same login form but signaling the admin context.

---

### Phase 3: Frontend - First-Time Login & Password Modals

**Objective**: Implement the client-side logic for forcing a password change and informing the user.

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

1.  **Create Reusable Password Change Modal**:
    *   **Action**: Create a new component `frontend/src/components/PasswordChangeModal.tsx`.
    *   **Content**: This modal will contain a form with fields for "Current Password", "New Password", and "Confirm New Password". It will be displayed as an overlay, preventing interaction with the rest of the app until the password is changed.

2.  **Implement Forced Password Change Logic**:
    *   **Action**: Modify `frontend/src/lib/AuthContext.tsx` or the main `_app.tsx` component.
    *   **Logic**: After a user logs in, check the `user.passwordChanged` flag received from the backend. If it is `false`, render the `PasswordChangeModal`.

3.  **Create Information Modal**:
    *   **Action**: Create a simple, reusable info modal component.
    *   **Functionality**: After the user successfully changes their password for the first time, this modal will appear.
    *   **Content**: It will briefly explain how to change their password in the future (e.g., "You can change your password anytime from your profile page.") and have a single "OK" button to dismiss.

4.  **Fix Existing Profile Page**:
    *   **Action**: Update the password change form in `frontend/src/pages/teacher-profile.tsx`.
    *   **Change**: Ensure it correctly calls the new `PUT /auth/users/:id/password` backend endpoint.
    *   **Future Task**: Create a similar settings/profile page for Moderators.

### Plan Summary

This plan addresses the user's request by first building the necessary backend infrastructure for robust password management, then creating a more professional, role-based login UI, and finally implementing the client-side logic to handle the first-time user experience. This phased approach ensures that dependencies are handled correctly and the final implementation is clean and functional.
