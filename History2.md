# PvtClass Tracker - Session Log

## Mission: Get the Application Running

Our primary goal is to get this application launched on a local computer so that you and your coworkers can start using it for its core purpose: tracking and recording classes.

This is **not** a commercial project. We are prioritizing a simple, functional, and free-to-run local deployment. Advanced features like cloud hosting, CI/CD pipelines, and extensive automated testing are **out of scope** for now and can be added much later if the need arises.

The immediate focus is getting a working application off the ground.

## Current Roadblock

The application currently fails to start because of two critical setup errors:

1.  **Incorrect Backend Script:** The main startup command is trying to run a script named `dev` for the backend, but the correct script is `start:dev`.
2.  **Missing Frontend Configuration:** The `frontend` directory is missing its own `package.json` file, which is essential for it to run as part of the project.

## Immediate Plan

To get the application working, we will perform the following two steps:

1.  **Fix the Backend Start Command:** Edit the root `package.json` file to call the correct `start:dev` script for the backend.
2.  **Create Frontend `package.json`:** Create the missing `package.json` file inside the `frontend` directory so it can be started correctly.

Once these two fixes are implemented, the `npm run dev` command should successfully launch the application.
