# Job Card: New Authentication Flow & UI - Phase 1

**Objective**: Enhance the backend API to support a new, more secure authentication flow, including a forced password change for new users and a role-based entry system.

### Backend API Enhancements for Password Management

1.  **Database Schema Update**:
    *   **Added `passwordChanged` Flag**: A new boolean field `passwordChanged` was added to the `User` model in `prisma/schema.prisma`.
    *   **Default Value**: It defaults to `false`, allowing the system to identify users logging in for the first time.
    *   **Migration**: Successfully ran `npx prisma migrate dev --name add-password-changed-flag` to apply the database changes.

2.  **Password Change Endpoint**:
    *   **Created `PUT /auth/users/:id/password`**: A new endpoint was added to `auth.controller.ts` to handle password update requests.
    *   **Secure Logic**: The endpoint is backed by a new `changePassword` method in `auth.service.ts`.

3.  **Service Logic Implementation (`changePassword`)**:
    *   **Validation**: The service logic securely validates the user's `currentPassword` using `bcrypt.compare` before allowing a change.
    *   **Forced Change Support**: The logic accommodates the forced password change flow by not requiring a `currentPassword` for first-time updates.
    *   **Secure Hashing**: The `newPassword` is securely hashed with `bcrypt.hash` before being stored.
    *   **Flag Update**: Upon a successful password change, the `passwordChanged` flag is set to `true`.

4.  **Enhanced Login Response**:
    *   **Modified `login` Method**: The `login` method in `auth.service.ts` was updated.
    *   **Returned `passwordChanged` Flag**: The user object returned upon successful login now includes the `passwordChanged` field, enabling the frontend to trigger the forced password change modal when necessary.

### Outcome

Phase 1 is complete. The backend is now fully equipped to handle the new, secure authentication and password management workflow. The database schema has been updated, and the necessary API endpoints and service logic are in place, setting the stage for the frontend implementation of the password change modals.

# Private Class Tracker - Rebuild Blueprint

**Objective**: A complete rebuild focusing on a stable foundation, simplicity, and core functionality. This document serves as the single source of truth for the new architecture.

---

## 1. Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Start with the most basic, essential features. Avoid complexity until the foundation is proven stable.
- **School-Centric**: The "School" is the primary container for all data. Users, students, and resources belong to a school.
- **Clear Roles**: A strict hierarchy of roles (Developer, Moderator, Teacher) with clearly defined permissions.
- **Incremental Development**: Build and test each component piece by piece.

---

## 2. System Architecture

A standard, modern web application stack:

- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS.
- **Backend**: NestJS with TypeScript.
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with an SQLite database file (for simplicity, upgradable later).
- **Communication**: REST API.

    subgraph "System Architecture"
        Frontend(Next.js Frontend) <--> Backend(NestJS Backend)
        Backend <--> DB[(Prisma ORM<br/>SQLite Database)]
    end

    subgraph "Data Model & User Flow"
        S(School) --> U(User <br/> MODERATOR / TEACHER)
        S --> C(Classroom)
        S --> ST(Student <br/> Information)
        
        U -- "Requests Booking" --> B(Booking)
        C -- "Is Booked for" --> B
        B -- "Requires Approval" --> M(Moderator)
        B -- "Requires Approval" --> D(Developer)
    end
```

---

## 3. Frontend Blueprint (`/frontend`)

- **`src/pages/index.tsx`**: The main startup page.
  - **Features**:
    - "Private Class Tracker" title with a pulsating purple-to-red galaxy glow.
    - List of existing schools fetched from the backend.
    - "Add School" link (for admin/developer use).
- **`src/pages/[schoolId]/login.tsx`**: A dynamic login page for a specific school.
- **`src/pages/[schoolId]/dashboard.tsx`**: The main homescreen after login.
  - **Features**:
    - Large calendar view showing all approved bookings for the school.
    - A button for teachers to open the "Request Booking" modal.
- **`src/pages/[schoolId]/classrooms.tsx`**: (Moderator only) A page to manage the school's classrooms (add, edit, view).
- **`src/pages/[schoolId]/students.tsx`**: (Moderator/Teacher) A page to manage student information records.

---

## 4. Backend Blueprint (`/backend`)

- **`SchoolsModule`**: Handles creating and listing schools.
- **`AuthModule`**: Manages login/logout for `MODERATOR` and `TEACHER` roles. Issues JWTs that are scoped to a `schoolId`.
- **`UsersModule`**: Handles creating user accounts within a school.
- **`ClassroomsModule`**: CRUD operations for classrooms, scoped to a `schoolId`.
- **`StudentsModule`**: CRUD operations for student information records, scoped to a `schoolId`.
- **`BookingsModule`**: The core scheduling logic.
  - Teachers can create a booking with a status of `PENDING_APPROVAL`.
  - Moderators and Developers can update the booking status to `APPROVED`.
  - The dashboard calendar will only fetch `APPROVED` bookings.

---

## 5. Database Schema (`/backend/prisma/schema.prisma`)

A simple, clean schema to start.

- **`School`**:
  - `id`, `name`
- **`User`**: (Represents Moderators and Teachers)
  - `id`, `email`, `password`, `role` (`MODERATOR` or `TEACHER`)
  - `schoolId` (a foreign key linking to the `School` model)
- **`Student`**: (Represents student information, not accounts)
  - `id`, `firstName`, `lastName`, `notes`
  - `schoolId` (a foreign key linking to the `School` model)
- **`Classroom`**:
  - `id`, `name`, `capacity`
  - `schoolId` (a foreign key linking to the `School` model)
- **`Booking`**:
  - `id`, `title`, `startTime`, `endTime`
  - `status` (`PENDING_APPROVAL`, `APPROVED`, `REJECTED`)
  - `moderatorApproved` (Boolean), `developerApproved` (Boolean)
  - `classroomId` (foreign key)
  - `teacherId` (foreign key)

---

## 6. Implementation Plan

1.  **Project Reset**: Delete existing `/frontend` and `/backend` directories.
2.  **Foundation Setup**: Initialize new, clean NestJS and Next.js projects.
3.  **Database & School API**: Set up the new Prisma schema and build the API for creating/listing schools.
4.  **Pulsating Startup Page**: Build the new `index.tsx` page with the animated title and connect it to the backend.
5.  **Iterative Build-Out**: Layer in the remaining features one by one: Auth, Classrooms, Students, and the Booking system.

---

## 7. Rebuild Progress Log

### ‚úÖ **Completed Steps**

- **Step 1: Project Reset**
  - The old `/frontend` and `/backend` directories have been successfully deleted.
- **Step 2: Foundation Setup (Partial)**

### ‚è≥ **Next Recommended Steps**

- **Step 3: Database & School API**
  1.  **Integrate Prisma**: Add Prisma to the new backend project.
  2.  **Define Schema**: Create the `schema.prisma` file with our new, simplified data models.
  3.  **Run Migration**: Generate and run the initial database migration to create the tables.
  4.  **Build Schools API**: Create the `SchoolsModule` in the backend to handle creating and listing schools.
- **Step 4: Pulsating Startup Page**
  1.  **Create Title Component**: Build the React component for the pulsating title.
  2.  **Build Page Layout**: Create the main startup page (`/src/app/page.tsx`).
  3.  **Connect to API**: Fetch the list of schools from the backend and display them.
